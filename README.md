# FRB Spatial Visualization

## Project Objective
This project aims to create a spatial visualization of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), plotting all known FRB locations on an interactive map and providing a predictive model to estimate potential locations for future FRB occurrences.

## Background
Fast Radio Bursts are brief but intense pulses of radio waves from distant regions of the universe. Since their discovery, FRBs have intrigued astronomers, offering insights into cosmic phenomena and distant galaxies. However, the origins of FRBs remain largely unknown, with only a fraction of their sources mapped across the sky.

## Project Overview
- **Current FRB Mapping**: Displays all known FRB locations using an interactive map.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses existing FRB data to model and predict probable locations of future FRBs.
- **Data Sources**: Utilizes current FRB databases, such as CHIME and other astronomical observatories.

## Features
- Real-time mapping of all known FRBs.
- Predictive visualization of likely future FRB occurrences.
- User interaction to explore data by location and potential FRB origins.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of machine learning models to improve predictive accuracy.
- Addition of user controls to filter by date, origin distance, and intensity.
